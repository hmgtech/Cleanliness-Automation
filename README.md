# Geo Waste detection system

Welcome to the Waste Detection App â€“ an innovative solution for identifying and categorizing waste using Flask, Python 3.8, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and TensorFlow. This application empowers users to contribute to environmental sustainability by providing a streamlined and efficient way to distinguish different types of waste, such as plastic and food waste.

# Published Paper:
- [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9418056)

## Features:
- Real-time Detection: Utilizing YOLO and TensorFlow, the app performs real-time waste detection, allowing users to capture or upload images for instant analysis.

- Waste Categorization: The application classifies detected waste into predefined categories, providing valuable insights into the composition of waste materials.

- User-Friendly Interface: With a clean and intuitive Flask-based web interface, users can easily interact with the application, making it accessible for a wide range of audiences.

- Environmental Impact: By identifying and categorizing waste, the app contributes to raising awareness about environmental issues and encourages responsible waste disposal practices.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.8
- Flask
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- TensorFlow
